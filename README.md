# Ember2 - Help Queue
##### April 2016
##### By Jeff Seymour, Mao Thygesen, Cassie Culkins

## Description
##### A simple Help Queue web app, like the student help queue at Epicodus.  
##### Allows a user to enter their name, computer location, and their question, which all get saved to a database. A user can then wait for help to arrive, or close the ticket if they've figured out the answer to their problem.   
##### From the teacher portal page, a user can view a list of students that need help, their location, question description, time elapsed, and can delete tickets from the queue.
